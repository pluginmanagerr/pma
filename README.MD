# PMA
Plugin MAnager for Vizality/Powercord.

## What is this?
This is a Plugin manager (like a package manager, but for plugins and themes) for linux/windows(thru wsl) systems that is compatible with Powercord and Vizality.

## How do I use this?
1. Clone the repo
2. Edit the THEMEDIR and DIR using your favorite text editor (Vi, Nano, etc.)
3. Run `make install` as root.


## What are the commands?
You can check the available commands using the `pma -h` command.

## I ran it, nothing happened.Why?
You need to run `pma -h` to see the commands and use it.

## What are the advantages of pma?
Well, there are couple of advantages.
1. Fast - Its much faster than getting plugins manually.
2. Simple - Even a baby can understand it.
3. Customizable - Since its just a shell script, everyone can customize it without much knowledge!

## Can I use this on Windows?
You can use this under wsl, if you point the dir to vizality folder through /mnt/c/.
Still not supported though as i dont run a windows machine.

## Im getting fx/git/curl command not found errors, how can I fix them?
You need to install fx/git/curl to use pma.

## Why are you using Bash and not this [random programming language] instead?
Bash is fast and easy to learn/modify, and it makes my job easier.
